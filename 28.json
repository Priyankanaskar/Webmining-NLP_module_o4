    "lyrics": "You took a train to the south side of Boston\r\nYou showed me where your old man stayed\r\nTook twenty-eight years of blood I was lost in\r\nTo feel loved on my own birthday\r\nAnd I always felt like I's in between something\r\nLike home and somewhere far away\n\nBut tonight, on the west side in a bar out in Brooklyn\n\nI saw tears outline your face\n\n\n\nHow lucky are we? It's been a hell of a week\n\nBut you're all grown now\n\nThere's smoke seepin' out of your bloody teeth\n\nBut you're home somehow\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be upstairs with the guitar I's given\n\nWhen I was barely fourteen\n\nWhen did McGlinchey's get so crowded\n\nAnd why are the crowds so damn green?\n\nI lost my mind on the streets of the city\n\nAnd maybe I lost all hope, too\n\nTook twenty-eight years of blood pumpin' through me\n\nTo get to this evening with you\n\n\n\nHow lucky are we? It's been a hell of a week\n\nBut we're all grown now\n\nThere's smoke seepin' out of the bar down the street\n\nBut we're home somehow\n\n\n\nHow lucky are we? It's been a hell of a week\n\nAnd we're all grown now\n\nThere's smoke seepin' out of the bar down the street\n\nBut we're home somehow\n\n\n\nYou took a train to the south side of Boston\n\nYou showed me where your whole heart stayed\n\nTook twenty-eight years of blood pumpin' through me\n\nTo feel loved on my own birthday"
